1.      Shamba mkononi is desired to achieve a digital farming solution to native farmers through the
        following specific objectives
        a.  Designing a system to predict the best agricultural crops to be grown based on the location
        and climate of the area
        b.  Establishing a marketplace where farmers can buy and sell their agricultural goods
        c.  Providing a forum or community for farmers to seek professional advice among each other or
        with a professional




2.      Project Rationale
        The drive for conducting shamba mkononi is the project aims at digitizing the agricultural sector
        through modern practices of farming, facilitating the agricultural market and expanding the
        agricultural community in Tanzania
        The shamba mkononi app aims to address several key challenges faced by farmers in accessing
        markets, obtaining relevant agricultural information and connecting with other farmers.


3.       Project Scope
        Shamba mkononi will involve the following boundaries;
        The application will be able to predict the suitable agricultural crops based on the season and
        location, then formulate ways for the best farming practices to ensure maximum yield. It will also provide a platform for farmers to buy and sell agricultural goods such as pesticides, seeds and the harvests (yields)
        Provision of a forum for farmers to discuss specific problems that they face in their daily
        endeavors and be able to solve them without even being physically present.

4.      Problem/Opportunity Statement
        Approximately 73% of the Tanzanian farmers are small scale farmers who practice small scale
        farming with local/poor methods of farming (subsistence farming) leading to poor/ low
        agricultural yields. This impacts the economy since agriculture is the backbone of our economy therefore suitable
        solutions have to be formulated in order to curb the ongoing chronic problem that has lasted
        almost 60 years. With the establishment of a mobile app that aids farmers in the farming process including on the
        modern farming methods will help to minimize the current situation. 


5. Project Implementation Mode
